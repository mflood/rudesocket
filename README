*** WINDOWS BUILDS ***

To build on windows, you will need to define WIN32 when compiling.
e.g. for Borland bcc32, cd to the src directory and run:

 bcc32 -c -DWIN32 *.cpp
 dir /B *.obj > objectlist.txt
 for /F %i in (objectlist.txt) do @tlib rudesocket.lib +%i

To include SSL support for windows, you must also define USING_OPENSSL
You will need to build openssl for your platform and locate the include 
directory that is created (/inc32)

 bcc32 -c -DWIN32 -DUSING_OPENSSL -I/OpenSSLPath/inc32 *.cpp 
 dir /B *.obj > objectlist.txt
 for /F %i in (objectlist.txt) do @tlib rudesocket.lib +%i
